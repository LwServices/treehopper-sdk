## .NET Core Support
%Treehopper does not currently support .NET Core apps running on macOS, due to <a href="https://github.com/treehopper-electronics/treehopper-sdk/issues/26">this bug</a>. This bug doesn't affect most users, who will build GUI apps that target the Xamarin.Mac framework, or console apps that target .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher (both execute using the Mono runtime).
